  - [Lucene.NET](http://lucenenet.apache.org/) Lucene.Net is a port of the Lucene search engine library, written in C# and targeted at .NET runtime users.
  - [PyLucene](http://lucene.apache.org/pylucene/) PyLucene is a Python extension for accessing Java LuceneTM. Its goal is to allow you to use Lucene's text indexing and searching capabilities from Python.
  - [Lucy](http://lucy.apache.org/) The Apache Lucy search engine library provides full-text search for dynamic programming languages. It is a "loose C" port of the Apache Luceneâ„¢ search engine library for Java.
  - [CLucene](http://clucene.sourceforge.net/) CLucene is a high-performance, scalable, cross platform, full-featured, open-source indexing and searching API. CLucene is faster than Lucene as it is written in C++, meaning it is being compiled into machine code, has no background GC operations, and requires no any extra setup procedures.
